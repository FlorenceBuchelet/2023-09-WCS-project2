# WILD CODE SCHOOL - Web Developer November 2023

Welcome to the second school project of our team: a virtual Museum on the Street Art pieces you can find in Lille, France, and the cities around.

This project lives locally on our devices and hasn't been deployed as of now.

It's been a real pleasure to work on that topic. We all see our cities a little differently now.
We hope this project brings a smile to your faces.
